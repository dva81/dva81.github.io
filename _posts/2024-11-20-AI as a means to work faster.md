# Context

I had a meeting and one of the topics was ‚Äúthe bench‚Äù. I had some thoughts on the matter and wanted to write a motivation that can help our organization. 

I also wanted to see how fast I could make a minimal viable paper üòâ with the help of generative AI and gave myself 30 minutes.

# Let‚Äôs get started

I wrote some key thoughts and gave them to ChatGPT https://openai.com/chatgpt/overview/

## First the initiatives

- The bench is not a punishment but an opportunity to grow, expand and train! 
- Content creation 
- Write use cases 
- Blog post and white papers Process improvement 
- Improve the estimation process 
- AI in development Certification 
- Get Certified Training Soft skill training ‚Äì communication Mastery of skill

## Then Action Plan

- Treat every initiative as a project and not individuals responsibility
- Administration - Dedicated project codes give insights in effort and result
- Connect initiatives to personal goals
- follow up is key ‚Äì people need guidance and leadership .There is no such thing as self-managing teams

## The result 

The draft document of this 30 minutes experiment is next.

# The Bench as an opportunity for growth

The concept of ‚Äúthe bench‚Äù is often seen in a negative light. However, in our organization, the bench is not a punishment but a valuable opportunity for our teams to grow, expand their skillsets, and train for the future. I would like to highlight several initiatives that can help us leverage this time productively, aligning with our long-term strategic goals.

## Content Creation

Bench time provides our team members with a unique opportunity to contribute to knowledge sharing and brand building through content creation, which helps position us as industry leaders.

Write Use Cases: Team members can document recent project experiences, challenges, and solutions that can serve as best practices for the organization and as valuable resources for future projects.

Blog Posts and White Papers: Encouraging employees to create blog posts or white papers on relevant industry topics will not only enhance their writing and communication skills but also elevate our company‚Äôs thought leadership and digital presence.

# Process Improvement  

Leveraging bench time to refine internal processes is another key area for focus. This can drive efficiency and innovation in our core operations.

Improve the Estimation Process: Employees can analyze historical data, identify trends, and develop improved project estimation frameworks that ensure more accurate forecasts for timelines, costs, and resources in future projects.

AI in Development: Investigating how AI tools can support and enhance our development processes is another area ripe for exploration. Team members can explore automation, machine learning models, or AI-driven testing processes that will improve efficiency.

## Certification  

Professional certifications not only advance an individual‚Äôs career but also enhance the company‚Äôs capabilities. Allocating time for employees on the bench to pursue certifications in relevant technologies or methodologies will equip our teams with cutting-edge knowledge.

Get Certified: Employees can pursue industry-recognized certifications (e.g., AWS, PMP, Agile, etc.) that align with their expertise and the company‚Äôs strategic objectives.

## Training & Development  

The bench provides an ideal moment for focused professional development through both hard and soft skills training.

Soft Skill Training ‚Äì Communication: Communication is critical to the success of every project. Offering communication workshops will improve team members' ability to collaborate effectively, articulate their ideas clearly, and engage with clients more professionally.

Mastery of Skills: Encourage employees to take time for deep dives into their technical specialties or explore new areas, ensuring they return to client projects with mastery in relevant technologies or methodologies.

# Action Plan: Maximizing the Bench as a Growth Opportunity

## Objective

Transform bench time into a structured, high-value growth opportunity by treating initiatives as formal projects, connecting them to personal goals, and ensuring accountability through leadership and oversight.

## Treat Every Initiative as a Project, Not an Individual Responsibility

  - Action Item: Formalize each initiative (content creation, process improvement, certification, training) as a project with clear deliverables, timelines, and objectives.

  - Steps:

    - Assign a project manager or lead to oversee each initiative, ensuring progress is tracked and goals are met.

    - Establish a project charter for each initiative to clearly define scope, objectives, stakeholders, and outcomes.

    - Ensure team members are aware that these initiatives are formalized projects, not just individual tasks or side assignments.

  - Success Metric: All initiatives are tracked in a project management system, with clear ownership and regular updates.

## Administration: Dedicated Project Codes to Track Effort and Results

  - Action Item: Assign dedicated project codes to all bench-related initiatives to track the time and effort spent on each.

  - Steps:

    - Work with the administration team to set up unique project codes for each bench initiative.

    - Ensure that all team members log their hours and progress against these codes in the project management or time-tracking system.

    - Use the data from these codes to review effort, productivity, and overall outcomes, allowing for better resource allocation in future bench periods.

  - Success Metric: 100% tracking of time spent on initiatives through project codes, leading to data-driven insights into the effectiveness of bench activities.

## Connect Initiatives to Personal Goals

  - Action Item: Align each initiative with the individual‚Äôs personal growth and development goals, ensuring the initiative adds value both to the organization and the employee.

  - Steps:

    - Conduct one-on-one meetings between managers and team members to discuss personal goals and identify which bench initiatives align with their professional development.

    - Assign individuals to initiatives that help them build skills or gain experience relevant to their career path.

    - Create individualized learning or achievement goals that are linked to the initiatives they are assigned to.

  - Success Metric: Each team member has a development plan that connects at least one bench initiative to their personal career goals.

## Follow-up Is Key: Leadership and Guidance are Crucial

   - Action Item: Establish regular follow-ups and check-ins with team members to provide leadership, support, and direction. Ensure that teams are guided and not left to self-manage.

  - Steps:

    - Schedule bi-weekly or weekly status meetings with initiative leads and team members to review progress, address challenges, and offer guidance.

    - Ensure project managers or team leads are providing clear guidance and setting expectations at each stage of the initiative.

    - Hold leadership accountable for providing regular feedback, mentoring, and removing obstacles that hinder progress.

  - Success Metric: Consistent follow-up and guidance result in project milestones being met on time, with minimal issues or delays due to lack of leadership.

##  No Self-Managing Teams: Provide Structured Oversight

  - Action Item: While encouraging ownership, ensure all teams have clear oversight and leadership to maintain direction and accountability.

  - Steps:

    - Assign a senior leader or project sponsor to each initiative to provide higher-level oversight and ensure alignment with organizational goals.

    - Establish a reporting structure where team leads report on progress, risks, and issues to their sponsors on a regular basis.

    - Implement review checkpoints where senior leadership can assess the impact of initiatives and make adjustments if needed.

  - Success Metric: All initiatives report progress to leadership on a structured basis, ensuring no initiative is neglected or lacks direction.

# Conclusion

By treating the bench as a structured opportunity for growth rather than downtime, we can foster a culture of continuous improvement and innovation within our teams. This approach will ensure that our employees remain sharp, motivated, and ready to deliver high-value solutions when they return to active projects. It will also reinforce our reputation as a learning organization that invests in the development of its people.

By formalizing bench initiatives as structured projects, assigning appropriate leadership, and connecting them to personal goals, we can ensure that bench time is productive, aligned with both individual and organizational growth, and contributes to long-term success.
