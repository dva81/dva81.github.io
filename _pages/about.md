Welcome to my digital space! 

I lead a dynamic team of highly skilled competence and solution leads at [Ordina](https://www.ordina.com) , driving impactful UiPath and Microsoft Power Platform projects for our enterprise clients. Our focus lies in revolutionizing business processes through Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and comprehensive business automation initiatives.

In my role as a freelance consultant, I specialize in empowering small businesses to optimize their utilization or migration to Microsoft 365. My expertise extends to tailoring the suite to align seamlessly with the unique needs of small enterprises. From enhancing online presence and streamlining communication to effective document management and collaboration. I am also still available for inquiries on Captiva/Intelligent Capture, the leading intelligent document processing and automation suite from OpenText.

In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly running and cycling), and spending time with friends and family.
