Welcome to my digital space! 

I lead a dynamic team of highly skilled competence and solution leads at [Ordina - SopraSteria](https://www.ordina.com) , driving impactful [UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/) and [Microsoft Power Platform](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/) projects for our enterprise clients. Our focus lies in revolutionizing business processes through Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and comprehensive business automation initiatives.

In my role as a freelance consultant, I specialize in empowering small businesses to optimize their utilization or migration to [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/nl-be/microsoft-365). My expertise extends to tailoring the suite to align seamlessly with the unique needs of small enterprises. From enhancing online presence and streamlining communication to effective document management and collaboration. I am also still available for inquiries on Captiva/Intelligent Capture, the leading intelligent document processing and automation suite from [OpenText](https://www.opentext.com/).

In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly running and cycling), and spending time with friends and family.
