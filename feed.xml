Recently, we ran into one of those “ghost bugs” in Microsoft Power Apps: no errors, no alerts, just a dead-calm editor window and an app that refused to behave.</p> <p>The team was working inside our ‘Development’ environment, tweaking an unmanaged solution (<em>SAM 2</em>) and specifically a canvas app called <em>Convention Management</em>. On paper, everything looked fine. The app opened. But that was about it. No UI. No reactions. No <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OnStart</code> logic firing. Even the monitoring tool—usually the first source of truth—showed nothing. It was like the app wasn’t even trying.</p> <p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18b0ae91-151c-4338-b143-24785df86f31" alt="Picture1"/></p> <p>Naturally, the team assumed it was something small—a bad reference, a corrupted control, maybe even a versioning hiccup. So we tried the basics: republish, reset, retrace my steps. No change. The app stayed silent. Changes weren’t recognized. Saving became impossible. It was as if Power Apps had decided to ignore its own existence.</p> <p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d5574dc-2ab3-4f64-8f5b-95fbc9a8b010" alt="Picture3"/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="the-fix-clean-import-clean-result">The Fix: Clean Import, Clean Result</h2> <p>First, I migrated the solution to a newly provisioned developer environment (‘DEV’, EU region). Fresh install, clean start. Imported the unmanaged solution. Same result. The ghost traveled with us.</p> <p>Then we tried something else. I took a copy of the application as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.msapp</code> file and uploaded it directly into the new environment—not as a solution import, but as a raw file injection. Suddenly, it worked. UI appeared. Controls rendered. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OnStart</code> logic triggered. The monitoring session populated like it should. The app, in every sense, had come back to life.</p> <blockquote> <p>That triggered the “why?” reflex. What changed?</p> </blockquote> <p>Turns out, the new environment had a specific setting: <strong>code components were not allowed</strong>. During import, a code component embedded in the app was quietly stripped out. That component—previously invisible and not throwing errors—was the blocker all along. Once removed, everything downstream behaved normally.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2> <p>It felt like debugging by subtraction. No massive refactoring, no extensive rewrites—just isolating the minimum environment, cutting out the noise, and letting Power Apps do its thing. From there, I could re-integrate connectors and rebuild customizations without issue.</p> <p>I also reapplied the same import-clean-fix technique back in the original development environment—and it worked there, too. Consistency confirmed. What was initially a one-off trick now became a repeatable fix. We’re using this same approach to rehabilitate other apps in our portfolio showing similar ghost symptoms.</p> <p>Here’s the ironic part: the component that caused the failure wasn’t critical. It wasn’t even in active use. Yet it blocked the entire app’s logic. That’s a dangerous reminder of how small, dormant fragments of configuration can take down mission-critical tools.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="practical-takeaways">Practical Takeaways</h2> <p>From a delivery perspective, this wasn’t just a Power Platform fix—it was a reflection of our design hygiene. Unused components, over-configured environments, and lack of control governance were the real culprits. As Power Platform continues to expand into more hands across the business, we must build with restraint and awareness, not just features and ambition.</p> <p>So what’s my takeaway?</p> <ol> <li><strong>If an app opens blank and silent, don’t assume user error.</strong><br/> Check the environment, the settings, and your components.</li> <li><strong>Use clean, restrictive environments for recovery.</strong><br/> They help surface hidden dependencies you might otherwise miss.</li> <li><strong>Treat code components with care.</strong><br/> If they’re not critical, don’t include them. Less is often more.</li> </ol> <p>This small win reminded me that pragmatic, low-friction debugging can outmatch brute-force rebuilds. Especially when working across environments, platform governance matters just as much as app logic.</p> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes, solving platform issues isn’t about knowing more—it’s about assuming less.</p> </blockquote> <hr/> <p>My focus is on structuring, automating and managing business processes using Agile and DevOps best practices.

Without a structured approach to defining the agent’s functional and technical scope, we risk building copilots that lack usability, accuracy, or security.</p> <p>At the heart of a copilot’s effectiveness are its <strong>functional requirements</strong>—what should it do, and how should it handle various user interactions? A clear <strong>purpose statement</strong> ensures that every decision made in development aligns with a tangible user need. Take customer service AI as an example: defining a “happy flow” where a user asks a question and receives a relevant, concise response minimizes frustration and increases adoption.</p> <p>However, not all user journeys are predictable. An AI agent must also handle <strong>“error flows”</strong>, guiding users to solutions when unexpected inputs arise. In financial services, for instance, a copilot assisting with tax queries should gracefully handle edge cases like ambiguous VAT rules, offering clarifications or escalating complex cases to human experts.</p> <p>Beyond interaction design, <strong>data quality and security</strong> determine a copilot’s reliability. A well-trained model needs <strong>structured, compliant knowledge sources</strong>—be it internal databases or external references. Imagine deploying a legal research assistant that references outdated or conflicting case laws; trust in the system would erode instantly.</p> <p>Finally, <strong>testing and iteration</strong> refine the copilot before deployment. In AI-driven automation, test scenarios should reflect real production data, ensuring the system performs under realistic conditions. A rule of thumb? A development dataset should be at least <strong>20% of the projected production volume</strong>, ensuring robustness before full-scale rollout.</p> <p>A copilot agent is only as good as its <strong>foundations</strong>. Defining clear intake criteria, understanding real-world application needs, and ensuring technical and security readiness—these are the pillars of a successful AI assistant.</p> <p>Here you can find a checklist with my most important intake criteria. <a href="/assets/pdf/Checklist-Intake_criteria_for_a_Copilot_Agent.pdf">Checklist-Intake criteria for a Copilot Agent</a></p> <hr/> <p>My focus is on structuring, automating and managing business processes using Agile and DevOps best practices.

But as my recent test of Microsoft Copilot Studio demonstrated, the effectiveness of AI is only as good as the data it relies on.</p> <h2 id="the-challenge-finding-the-right-answers">The Challenge: Finding the Right Answers</h2> <p>Our goal was to evaluate how well the Copilot could retrieve precise answers from the database. The results were mixed. The AI struggled to provide exact matches, primarily due to limitations in data quality and structure.</p> <p>Here’s what we discovered:</p> <ul> <li>The database consisted of .docx documents structured around email-style Q&amp;A exchanges.</li> <li>The search function relied on exact matching of specific content rather than semantic variations of questions.</li> <li>There was no way to test alternative phrasing or conversational queries.</li> <li>Overlapping and inconsistent answers in the dataset made it difficult for the AI to return a definitive response.</li> <li>The business requirements did not allow for AI-generated responses. Only pre-existing text could be retrieved.</li> <li>Data integrity was maintained, as business stakeholders controlled ownership, but this also meant we couldn’t manipulate data to test ideal scenarios.</li> </ul> <h2 id="key-takeaways-fixing-the-foundation">Key Takeaways: Fixing the Foundation</h2> <p>To improve future AI deployments, we need to rethink our approach:</p> <ul> <li><strong>More realistic queries:</strong> Business users must provide better-structured questions to test the AI’s interpretation skills.</li> <li><strong>Improved data quality:</strong> Using platforms like SharePoint to enhance metadata tagging can refine search accuracy.</li> <li><strong>Reducing ambiguity:</strong> Clearer, more distinct responses will help the AI deliver precise answers rather than conflicting outputs. Go in interaction with the data owners to modify the data where possible, under their control.</li> </ul> <h2 id="real-world-implications">Real-World Implications</h2> <p>This isn’t just a technical issue—it’s an operational one. In industries where compliance and accuracy are non-negotiable. AI can’t provide trustworthy automation if it’s built on inconsistent, unstructured data. Our test reinforced a fundamental truth: even the most advanced AI can’t compensate for poor data quality. If the input is flawed, the output will be unreliable.</p> <h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2> <p>While our test exposed limitations, it also revealed opportunities. With better data structuring, metadata tagging, and an improved approach to question formulation, AI copilots can be a powerful tool.

Lately, the term “agents” seems to dominate conversations around business process efficiencies. While the buzz is undeniable, I often find myself questioning whether agents and chatbots are truly the most efficient solutions for addressing workflow challenges.</p> <h1 id="a-means-to-an-end">A means to an end</h1> <p>In our team, we recently embarked on creating an agent designed to integrate seamlessly into a Microsoft Teams channel. Its primary function is straightforward: it prompts everyone in the channel to answer a questions it receives from another bot, redirecting their collective input as an answer to a customer. At first glance, this might seem like an efficient approach to managing inquiries, but there’s an underlying question that needs addressing.</p> <blockquote> <p>“Who takes ownership of this query?”</p> </blockquote> <p>The introduction of agents into workflows brings with it the promise of automation and streamlining. However, it can also risk introducing ambiguity, especially when it comes to accountability. In traditional settings, responsibility often falls upon individuals or dedicated roles. With agents, the lines can blur. Is the agent itself accountable? Or do we rely on human oversight to ensure the job gets done?</p> <blockquote> <p>“Like a Parent WhatsApp Group: AI Agents Keep the Conversation Going, but Someone’s Gotta Wrap It Up.”</p> </blockquote> <p>In our case, while the agent serves as the conduit for gathering input, we’ve established clear protocols for assigning responsibility. The agent’s role is to ask, document, and redirect—human ownership, however, remains integral to ensuring quality and resolution. It’s this delicate interplay between human effort and AI augmentation that underscores the need for thoughtful implementation.</p> <h1 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h1> <p>As businesses continue to embrace the potential of agents, it’s imperative to evaluate their impact not only on efficiency but also on clarity and collaboration within teams. After all, tools should enhance, not complicate, our workflows. It’s not just about adopting the latest technology; it’s about ensuring that technology serves the people behind it.</p> <hr/> <p>My focus is on structuring, automating and managing business processes using Agile and DevOps best practices.

In this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/azure-devops-easily-deploy-power-platform-solution-dennis-van-aelst-mzfpe/?trackingId=Zt9plSeCTg2OyehjOFpuog%3D%3D">Azure DevOps: Easily deploy a Power platform solution - LinkedIn</a> article, I gave an example on how to create a simple DevOps pipeline.</p> <p>This time I will show you two advanced pipelines to export and import a Power Platform solution with a GITHUB connection. The thought behind this is that the highly regulated enterprises have more complex working environments and deployment needs.</p> <ul> <li>Many developers are working on the same solution in different development environments.</li> <li>Code or configuration check must be done before deploying preferably automated</li> <li>Branching and merging policies.</li> <li>Standard configurations must be added automatically after development</li> </ul> <h1 id="setting-the-stage">Setting the stage</h1> <p>We will be using the following components.</p> <ul> <li>Azure DevOps environment for the build and release pipelines</li> <li>GITHUB repository for storing the configuration and merging the different brances</li> <li>Power Platform environment with a solution to export</li> </ul> <p>The example will be importing from only one environment but it can be extended if needed. If you are reading this article, I can safely assume you know your way around Microsoft Power Platform. However source control is not always related to low code so if you are new to GITHUB check out this Beginner’s guide to GitHub repositories: <a href="https://github.blog/2024-06-24-beginners-guide-to-github-repositories-how-to-create-your-first-repo/">How to create your first repo - The GitHub Blog</a></p> <h1 id="build">Build</h1> <p>There are two pipelines. Get the Solution and Pack and drop.</p> <p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5dd9d6ee-4239-458a-a15f-5a0e658ed683" alt="Build"/></p> <h2 id="get-the-solution">Get the Solution</h2> <p>The goal is to export the solution from the Power Platform environment and store the configuration in GITHUB under a new branch. This way all the components are available in source control and can be handled in code as well. This makes batch updates and checks easier, creating a new version ready to be released via the pack and drop pipeline.</p> <p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ca58311-b0c7-4854-a3b3-99b42f81540f" alt="Get the Solution"/></p> <p>The first three tasks are simple. Before they start, the Checkout – job creates / clones the Github repo on the agents file system. This way we can use that location to clean the repository before unpacking the solution in that location.</p> <p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48762fd5-985f-4876-a374-871ae7cd5893" alt="Checkout"/></p> <p>In the Clean repo step, The GIT rm command is used to remove the old configuration making it ready to accept the new incoming.</p> <p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/801024a4-f39b-4178-bbdc-bca224ed6750" alt="Clean"/></p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>write-host "Set location"

The result is a deployable artifact that can be released to any environment. I did not show the deployment settings in the example. Check out my other article for that. You will need to incorporate all connections references and other dependancies like custom connectors.</p> <p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e500ec17-0284-4b47-8b32-3191725d0e80" alt="Pack and drop"/></p> <h1 id="release-pipelines">Release pipelines</h1> <p>The release pipeline is easy. We are working with managed solutions. Unmanaged is not advised! Microsoft considers these as still under development, and you can import or export as unmanaged. You can modify unmanaged solutions. Managed solutions are complete solutions ready for distribution that you cannot modify after importing them to the selected environment. These solutions are intended for production environments.

You can even make this dynamic if you incorporate pipelines and scripts for environment provisioning and use the API for Azure DevOps to automatically create pipelines and release configurations.</p> <p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f0f5ffb-4e73-4699-88bd-7f27542f00d6" alt="release"/></p> <h1 id="a-parting-note">A parting note</h1> <p>This way method provides a way to introduce all capabilities of modern version control on all aspects of a Power Platform solution. Beware though. You are merging configurations, not real code. The syntax may be ok but that does not mean it will work! The Power Platform is not really intended to use this way.

Understanding the differences, strengths, and best use cases for each can help organizations make informed decisions. This post explores the key aspects of Skills and Connectors, and provides guidance on selecting the right approach for your projects.</p> <h1 id="understanding-connectors">Understanding Connectors</h1> <p>Connectors in the Power Platform provide a low-code solution to integrate various services and applications. This approach is particularly useful for users who want to extend API calls without delving into extensive coding. Here are some key points about Connectors:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Preview Availability</strong>: Connectors are currently available in preview within the Power Platform.</li> <li><strong>Low-Code Approach</strong>: Designed for ease of use, enabling users to integrate services with minimal coding.</li> <li><strong>DLP Policy Impact</strong>: Data Loss Prevention policies apply, with standard limitations allowing 500 calls per minute per connector. These limits are adjustable based on the environment.</li> <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: Proper authentication needs to be verified to ensure secure connections.</li> </ul> <h1 id="exploring-skills">Exploring Skills</h1> <p>Skills offer a more flexible, pro-code approach, requiring Azure infrastructure. This method is ideal for users with coding expertise who need to implement complex customizations. Key features of Skills include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Pro-Code Flexibility</strong>: Greater flexibility due to the ability to write and modify code.</li> <li><strong>Azure Infrastructure</strong>: Requires setup and management of Azure resources.</li> <li><strong>Extended Capabilities</strong>: Skills can extend further than connectors, especially when paired with Copilot extensions.</li> </ul> <h1 id="user-experience-in-copilot">User Experience in Copilot</h1> <p>Regardless of whether you choose Skills or Connectors, the user experience within Copilot remains largely consistent. Both methods aim to streamline the integration process and enhance functionality.</p> <h1 id="making-the-decision">Making the Decision</h1> <p>For Proof of Concept (POC) use cases, the primary strategy is to use custom connectors. This approach allows for quick integration and testing without extensive coding. However, it’s crucial to continuously evaluate the technical and functional requirements of your project. If the need for more advanced customization arises, considering Skills might be necessary.</p> <h1 id="action-plan">Action Plan</h1> <p>To effectively implement Connectors or Skills, consider the following steps:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Performance Overview</strong>: Assess performance needs and peak usage to estimate the number of API calls required.</li> <li><strong>Limit Adjustments</strong>: Adjust limits as necessary and manage these changes from an Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) perspective.</li> <li><strong>Performance Testing</strong>: Conduct thorough performance testing to ensure the chosen method meets your requirements.</li> </ol> <p>By carefully evaluating your project’s needs and understanding the capabilities of both Skills and Connectors, you can make informed decisions that align with your goals and resources.</p> <hr/> <p>For more detailed information on using Microsoft Bot Framework skills and Power Platform connectors, refer to the official <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Copilot Studio documentation</a>.</p> <hr/> <p>My focus is on structuring, automating and managing business processes using Agile and DevOps best practices.
