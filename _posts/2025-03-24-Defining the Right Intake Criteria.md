# From Concept to Copilot: Defining the Right Intake Criteria  

AI copilots are reshaping how we interact with digital systems, but their success is not accidental—it starts with well-defined intake criteria. Without a structured approach to defining the agent’s functional and technical scope, we risk building copilots that lack usability, accuracy, or security. 

At the heart of a copilot’s effectiveness are its **functional requirements**—what should it do, and how should it handle various user interactions? A clear **purpose statement** ensures that every decision made in development aligns with a tangible user need. Take customer service AI as an example: defining a "happy flow" where a user asks a question and receives a relevant, concise response minimizes frustration and increases adoption.

However, not all user journeys are predictable. An AI agent must also handle **"error flows"**, guiding users to solutions when unexpected inputs arise. In financial services, for instance, a copilot assisting with tax queries should gracefully handle edge cases like ambiguous VAT rules, offering clarifications or escalating complex cases to human experts.

Beyond interaction design, **data quality and security** determine a copilot’s reliability. A well-trained model needs **structured, compliant knowledge sources**—be it internal databases or external references. Imagine deploying a legal research assistant that references outdated or conflicting case laws; trust in the system would erode instantly.

Finally, **testing and iteration** refine the copilot before deployment. In AI-driven automation, test scenarios should reflect real production data, ensuring the system performs under realistic conditions. A rule of thumb? A development dataset should be at least **20% of the projected production volume**, ensuring robustness before full-scale rollout.

A copilot agent is only as good as its **foundations**. Defining clear intake criteria, understanding real-world application needs, and ensuring technical and security readiness—these are the pillars of a successful AI assistant.
