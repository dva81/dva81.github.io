Welcome!

As a Principal Consultant at [Sopra Steria](https://www.soprasteria.be/), I lead dynamic teams of skilled consultants, delivering impactful [UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/) and [Microsoft Power Platform](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/) projects for enterprise clients. My focus is on revolutionizing business processes through Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and comprehensive business automation. By spearheading complex projects, nurturing client relationships, and mentoring junior and medior consultants, I ensure strategic alignment, foster professional growth, and develop innovative solutions tailored to client needs. With a commitment to driving measurable results!

In my role as a freelance consultant, I specialize in empowering small businesses to optimize their utilization or migration to [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/nl-be/microsoft-365). My expertise extends to tailoring the suite to align seamlessly with the unique needs of small enterprises. From enhancing online presence and streamlining communication to effective document management and collaboration. I am also still available for inquiries on Captiva/Intelligent Capture, the leading intelligent document processing and automation suite from [OpenText](https://www.opentext.com/).

In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly running and cycling), baking bread and spending time with friends and family.
